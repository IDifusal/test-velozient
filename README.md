# Nuxt - Vue - Tailwind - SCSS
## Why Nuxt?
Well i have a lot of experience using this meta framework of Vue, Nuxt provides a many tools and default configurations like routing and layouts config (i've used both tools in this proyects)
## About the approach
I always look for encapsulate as many components as i can, that makes easy to reuse the code and also for mainteinance porposes
