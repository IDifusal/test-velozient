# Test Velozient [Production Deployment Link](https://test-velozient.vercel.app/)
# Nuxt - Vue - Tailwind - SCSS
## Why Nuxt?
Well i have a lot of experience using this meta framework of Vue, Nuxt provides a many tools and default configurations like routing and layouts configs (i've used both tools in this proyects)
## About the approach
I always look for encapsulate as many components as i can, that makes easy to reuse the code and also for mainteinance porposes, this means that i have to use a lo of props, events, or use vuex but for this example i dont think was necessary.

About the backend i can create it using Laravel, Nodejs or Firebase but i can see that you are looking for a C# backend it will took me some time to learn
